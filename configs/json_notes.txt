model_type  
Type of disk profile to generate.  
Example values: gaussian_ring, cavity, two_ring.

r1  
Radius where the ring peaks, in astronomical units (AU).

sigma1  
Standard deviation (width) of the ring, in AU.

disk_R90  
Radius enclosing 90 percent of the total disk flux, in AU.  
Used to set the physical scale of the image.

disk_flux  
Total disk flux in millijanskys (mJy).  
Used to normalize the model profile.

inclination  
Disk inclination in degrees.  
0 is face-on, 90 is edge-on.

PA  
Position angle of the disk in degrees.  
Measured East of North.

distance  
Distance to the source in parsecs.

RA  
Right Ascension of the source in HH:MM:SS format.

Dec  
Declination of the source in Â±DD:MM:SS format.

ALMA_configuration  
Name of the ALMA antenna configuration file (e.g. alma.cycle10.7.cfg).  
These files are located in the folder alma-configuration-files.

integration_time  
Total simulated integration time in seconds.

central_freq  
Central observing frequency in hertz (Hz).  
Example: 230000000000.0 means 230 GHz (Band 6).

bandwidth  
Total bandwidth in Hz.  
Example: 8000000000.0 means 8 GHz.

pwv  
Precipitable water vapor in millimeters.  
Used to simulate atmospheric conditions.
